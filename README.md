# quantum-k-means
A Qiskit implementation of a version of the quantum k-means algorithm.

# Main purpose
Quantum machine learning involves integrating the principles of quantum mechanics to machine learning algorithms. This is accomplished by using quantum algorithms
(instead of classical ones) to implement the machine learning techniques. The aim is to study the potential of quantum algorithms to outperform classical algorithms in terms of time complexity for specific problems. This is known as quantum speedup and can potentially be exploited to make machine learning
algorithms more efficient. As an example we will consider the quantum version of the k-means clustering machine learning algorithm and implement a simple model using Qiskit.
